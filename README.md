# Fish Freshness Detection Web Application

This project is a prototype web application designed to detect the freshness of fish using machine learning. Inspired by research, it demonstrates the feasibility of applying AI to address real-world challenges in food quality assessment.

## 📚 Project Inspiration

I recently came across a fascinating paper on fish freshness detection:  
[Read the Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-024-04493-0)

This research sparked my curiosity. I wondered how we could practically detect whether a fish is fresh or not using technology. Motivated by this idea, I decided to build a prototype to test its feasibility.

## 💡 Project Overview

This web application allows users to:  
1. **Upload or capture images** of fish.  
2. Analyze the image using a trained machine learning model.  
3. Display the result as either **"Fresh"** or **"Not Fresh"**.

The prototype is a proof of concept, showcasing the potential for machine learning in food quality assurance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Model Training:** Teachable Machine (Google)  
- **Frontend:** Gradio  
- **Backend:** Python  
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Dataset Collection:**  
   - Collected images of a single fish type to train the model.  
   - Focused on key visual indicators of freshness.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Trained the dataset using Google's Teachable Machine to classify fish as fresh or not fresh.

3. **Web Application:**  
   - Developed a simple and user-friendly interface using Gradio.  
   - Deployed the app on Hugging Face for public access.
